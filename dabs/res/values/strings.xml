    <string name="about_text_part2">Hi, I\'m Danilo Bargen. As a paragliding pilot, I find this kind of information useful and important, but the PDF version of the DABS by Skyguide is not too convenient on the go. This app tries to make that easier.\n\nIf you want to contact me, just send an e-mail to mail@dbrgn.ch or a tweet to @dbrgn.</string>
